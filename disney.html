          <h1>How Disney Will Profit Post-Pandemic</h1>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Huge numbers of businesses have suffered greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Disney has been no exception. Its theme parks have been closed for a year, which could have doomed the company’s financials. However, Disney has many revenue streams, and I wanted to look at those and figure out how well the company is situated for a post-pandemic future.

            The media company that I chose to analyze is Disney. Over the years, Disney has carefully masterminded a family friendly public image. In order to maintain this image there must be compliance from the company’s staff to keep operations of the business private. Disney has their employees sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to maintain confidentiality of operations from competitors along with the public in terms of how operations are run. Furthermore, in part of the employee contracts, Disney may include non-compete clauses for their higher-up employees in order to protect the integrity of the company from competitors. Additionally, Disney enters a bilateral contract with their employees. Disney promises to pay their employees a certain amount of money and in exchange the employees agree to provide their services for whatever agreed upon time. The company also enters licensing agreements with brands including Lucasfilm, Marvel, ABC, ESPN, DisneyPixar, etc. It was reported by theorem.com that in 2006, the company reached 56.6bn in licensed merchandise sold. Disney also has numerous broadcasting agreements. Disney owns ESPN, ABC, Lifetime, History and other channels, so when these channels license intellectual property they must reach a broadcasting agreement.

            Disney has faced a fair share of privacy issues in the past. Disney, in order to get more information about their guests, has monitored usage of its smartphone apps and their band they created called the MagicBand. Through technology, the company was able to track customers’ rides they were partaking in and the characters that drew the attention of children. Although people authorized the usage of these devices in order to use them, privacy concerns were brought to attention as to how much information the user was giving the company. On a separate occasion, Disney had a breach of privacy when thousands of Disney Plus accounts were hacked and then sold online. Soon after the company launched the Disney Plus streaming service, hackers were able to breach customers’ data along with selling their accounts online for as little as $3. Many people were left susceptible to credential stuffing and were left scrambling to change their passwords on other platforms after their accounts got hacked.

            Presently, with parks being closed because of Covid-19, it is assumed by many that it may take years for Disney to continue their normal operations. Ideas are being tossed around such as Disney potentially requiring all visitors to take tests for Coronavirus if the parks were to open anytime soon. In the past health officials have released information on individuals who tested positive for measles. According to governing.com, “In addressing a measles outbreak in May, the state Department of Public Health was able to release information on exactly where infected patients had traveled so members of the public could determine for themselves whether they had been exposed and needed to seek medical attention and quarantine.” Although the safety of people were a priority in releasing this medical information, people raised concerns for privacy of medical information. Consequently, if Disney required guests to test for the virus the company would have to face the fine line of protecting the safety and privacy of their workers and customers visiting. The article also states companies could face discrimination, isolation, and retribution if people’s identities are released.

            Disney has also faced issues with defamation lawsuits filed against the company. BPI, a South Dakota-based meat processor, sued ABC for over a billion dollars, on reports made in 2012 over the companies usage of finely textured beef products. The report made by ABC contained critics call the product “pink slime” and claim that BPI never disclosed that the product was used in their beef”. BPI stated that the reporting “ put a significant dent in its bottom line. CNN reported that, “Disney said it paid $177 million that was "incurred in connection with the settlement of litigation," at least some of which was related to a years-long legal dispute with South Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc.”

            Disney owns an array of majority intellectual properties consisting of companies and brands. According to nofilmschool.com, the companies Disney owns consists of BC, ESPN (80% stake) , TouchStone Pictures, Marvel, Lucasfilm, A&E (50% equity with Hearst Corporation), Lifetime (50% equity holding with Hearst Corporation), Pixar, Hollywood Records, Vice Media (10% stake), and Core Publishing. The brands that Disney owns consist of Star Wars, The Muppets, The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney Princesses/Princes, The Chronicles of Narnia Franchise, The Pirates of the Caribbean Franchise, Pixar Films, The Winnie the Pooh Franchise, The Indiana Jones Franchise, and Grey’s Anatomy.

            The pandemic has hit Disney hard and it was reported by the company that a 1.4 billion dollar loss last quarter was a result of the coronavirus. The asset that will become more important during the pandemic will be Disney’s streaming service, Disney Plus. The streaming numbers for the service can flourish during the pandemic if Disney continuously adds new and entertaining content. Disney has reported that subscriptions have now surpassed 50 million. To put this into context, Disney previously had around 28 million subscribers before the Coronavirus. Disney also has the opportunity to release movies on their service that were already seen in movie theaters earlier than intended in order to keep their subscription numbers rising. Disney could also use the platform to form relationships with new customers and drive business to theme parks and their releasing movies in theaters when the virus is under control. Disney also can take this time while their parks are closed to take measures on how to operate more efficiently and address ways to make people feel safe when operations are back to usual. Disney could potentially take people’s temperature when they enter parks in order to ease health concerns. Additionally Disney could require guests to wear masks and continue practicing safe social distancing measures when the parks reopen. In conclusion, despite Disney taking a large financial loss during the pandemic, the company can benefit from their streaming service and by taking proper safety measures for their customers.
